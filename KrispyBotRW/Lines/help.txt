Here's what I know I can do (as long as you prefix it with `$`):
 ```
 [help] - Lists all comm- okay why do people even write this here?
 [play] <game/games> - Adds games to your role list (you will be notified when someone mentions the group).
 [leave] <game/games> - Removes games from your role list.
 [schedule] <classes> - Updates your schedule with new classes.
 [add/remove] <games/classes> - Adds or removes roles.
 [nickname] <new nickname> - Resets your server nickname.
 [nsfw] - Opt into the NSFW channel. Beware, you won't be able to undo this (unless you ask a mod)!
 [ninja] <mention> - Engage your friend in a duel to the death between each other's ninjas.
 [leaderboard] - Show the activity leaderboard. See how you're comparing to other members.
 ```
 
 Have an idea for a command? Go bother `@desgroup#0675` and he'll add it.
