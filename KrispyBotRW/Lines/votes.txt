I registered your vote.
I voted for you- not because I like you or anything, baka!
You better be grateful that I r-registered your vote! *blushes*
I registered your vote, but I could've d-done it without you, stupid!
I just happened to register your v-vote.
I guess I can register your vote. *hmph*
I have some extra v-votes. You can have them, b-but its not because I wanted you to have them or anything!
