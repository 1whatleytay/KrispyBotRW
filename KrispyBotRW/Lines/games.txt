Be sure to add "PC" or "Console" to your request.
Oh great! You play Paladins? I never knew. I'm a little curious on what you play it on.
Sad to see you leave Paladins... I just want to know on which platform.
Sooo... you play Brawlhalla? But on what?
Brawlhalla says bye bye. But where? On your desktop monitor or your TV screen?
Heh. You play Fortnite? That's interesting. Quick question: What do you play it on?
Okay. Not playing Fortnite anymore? Are you not playing it on your Desktop or Console?
Sneaky... I'll just pretend I didn't see that.
You play {0}? I never knew. Here, I'll add that role for you.
Nice! I've added those games to your role list if you don't mind.
Sad to see you leave {0}. Here, I'll remove that role from you.
Well, I've removed those games from your role list.
You didn't specify a single game... try again?
